Unit 20 Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

by Christopher Reutz

Two datasets were used from Citi Bike.</br>
<ul>
<li>May 2014 Trip Data. https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201405-citibike-tripdata.zip</li>
<li>May 2019 Trip Data. https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201905-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip</li>
</ul></br>
Pandas was used to merge dataset into a single file.</br>
<ul>
<li>201405_201905-citibike-tripdata.csv</li>
</ul></br>
The merged CSV along with both source CSVs are too large to store in GitHub and thus are omitted (.gitignore).</br>
